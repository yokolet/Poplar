A sample for JRuby extension. 
See my blog post, http://yokolet.blogspot.com/2011/05/extending-jruby.html

Of course the purpose of the Fraction class for ruby has been somewhat superseeded with ruby-2.1.0 supporting a very concise syntax for rationals. I am keeping my copy just in case I find cause to work with Apache commons-math (although latterly that seems unlikely).


Actually I've found another reason to keep this I've updated the extesion not to use a separate Service class.
